				Prof. Achyuta Samanta is an educationist, philanthropist, and social worker. He is the founder of
				Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT) and Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS), both
				educational institutions of global repute and recognition. KIIT is an Institution of Eminence and one of
				the most prominent universities in India and globe for professional education having more than 30,000
				students from all over India and 53 other countries. KISS is a home for 60,000 indigenous children all
				absolutely free.<br><br>

				Besides Education and tribal upliftment, healthcare and rural development, Shri. Samanta has contributed
				immensely to art, culture, literature, film, media, society and national integration. It is really
				incredible that the child who lost his father at the age of four, brought up amidst severe poverty and
				deprivation with seven siblings and a widow mother in a quaint village in Odisha has accomplished this
				monumental work without any favour or backing in such a short span of time for the society. He has
				converted the remote village ‘Kalarabanka’, Cuttack into a Smart Village and the entire Manpur Panchayat
				into a model Panchayat (cluster of villages).<br><br>

				He has been conferred with more than 50 International and National awards and over 200 state awards
				besides two highest Civilian Awards from Royal Kingdom of Bahrain and Mongolia. He has been conferred
				with 44 Honorary Doctorate awards from universities in India and abroad. He is the first Odia to be a
				member of both UGC and AICTE. He is currently the Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha) from Kandhamal,
				Odisha and also the President of Volleyball Federation of India.<br><br>

				As a social reformer, he has been propagating “Art of Giving” (philosophy of life), a concept aimed at
				bringing peace and happiness around the globe. <br><br>

				Despite all his achievements, he leads a simple lifestyle, keeps on marching towards the cause of
				spreading smile among millions and achieving zero poverty, zero hunger, zero illiteracy.

				One of the oldest civilizations in the world, India is a mosaic of multicultural experiences. With a
				rich heritage and myriad attractions, the country is among the most popular tourist destinations in the
				world. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the
				tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the
				rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct
				geographical entity.

				Fringed by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers
				off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. As you
				travel the expanse of the country, you are greeted by diverse nuances of cuisines, faiths, arts, crafts,
				music, nature, lands, tribes, history, and adventure sports. India has a mesmeric conflation of the old
				and the new. As the bustling old bazaars rub shoulders with swanky shopping malls, and majestic
				monuments accompany luxurious heritage hotels, the quintessential traveler can get the best of both
				worlds. Head to the mountains, enjoy a beach retreat, or cruise through the golden Thar, India has
				options galore for all.
				India is home to the finest architectural heritage, serene ghats, spectacular landscapes, and the
				largest tiger reserve.
