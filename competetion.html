							<p><b> #StriveToThrive</b></p>

							<p>When words fail, art, in all of its forms, steps in. We live in a country where the
								entertainment industry is thriving, but in the midst of it all, we must remember that we
								are not individuals, but members of a larger society and our responsibility to that
								society must not be overlooked. KGT is a forum where individuals may express themselves
								via music, dance, theatre, and creative writing while keeping our society and our
								responsibilities to it in mind.</p>

							<p><b>Theme</b> </p>

							<p>Participants who want to showcase their skills should remember that their
								performance/write-ups should be focused on the following topic :</p>

							<p>
								<li><i></i>"She's a muse to herself".Feminism is the conviction that women should have
									complete social, economic, and political equality. Let the women of our society
									strive
									and flourish.
								<li><i>"Child abuse leaves a lifetime's worth of scars".</i> Abusing a
									child is as terrible as murdering a person because children are naturally
									vulnerable,
									and whatever abuse they experience in their early years leaves a permanent mark on
									their
									minds. Let us strive for a better world for the children.
								<li><i>"Making someone else
										appear awful is never a good look".</i> Let's bring an end to bullying.
								<li><i>"By helping others, we may soar".</i> Helping others is not only beneficial to
									them and a noble act, but it also makes us happier and healthier. Let us all strive
									to
									be happy and healthy.
								<li><i>"Let our hearts be overflowing with gratitude and
										generosity".</i>
								<li> <i>"You will smile once again".</i> The mind is one of the
									body's most powerful organs, controlling the functions of all other organs. It is
									critical for everyone to strive for a balance between mental and physical well-being
									and
									to seek assistance when either falters.
								<li><i>"Go green to breathe clean".</i>It is
									only feasible to live a healthy life if the basic demand of clean air and land is
									provided. A pollution-free and green environment equates to a higher level of life.
							</p>

							<p><b> Rules and regulations:</b></p>

							<p>
								<li><b>DANCE:</b> Participants should submit a video of themselves dancing. The video
									should be no
									more than three minutes long. The outfit, props, and performances of the
									participants
									will be evaluated. The dance should be relevant to the issues mentioned above.</li>

									Participants should record themselves singing and submit it as a video. The video
									should
									not go more than three minutes. The song can be self-written and connected to the
									above-mentioned issues. Participants can sing while playing an instrument or
									instruments.</li>
								<li><b> WRITE-UP:</b> On the above-mentioned subjects, participants can produce short
									stories, personal essays, poetry, short plays, memoirs, and speeches. Participants
									must
									submit their writing as a pdf file. The writing should be original and not
									plagiarised
									from other sources.</li>

							<p><b> #CreativityFullofPositivity</b><br><br> &ldquo;<b>Kanvassing</b> &rdquo; - an event,
								to procreate the hues of
								one&rsquo;s imagination on a blank canvas. A pencil, a brush, and a few colours, or
								perhaps just one of these, is all that is required to produce a work of art that will
								make others pause and marvel. Beautiful art can be both inspiring and intriguing. Some
								of them simply awaken the creativity or beauty inside of us all and makes us think about
								the issues deeper. No matter the level of intensity of the piece, great artworks cause
								most people to stop if even for just a moment, to have an emotional experience. And this
								experience, these emotions, will be re-lived every time the viewer encounters that piece
								of art again. This is why art created to raise awareness for a cause can work so well.
								The artwork creates a powerful and lasting emotion that moves the viewer to action to
								take the initiative to solve the problem.</p>

							<p><b> Theme:</b> &nbsp; This time, our goal is not simply to ponder but to create pieces
								that make people
								question and think about themselves, their loved ones, and the lifestyle they lead. The
								topics have been settled upon India Against Negativity and the Art of Giving. How do you
								want to see India fighting against Negativity Happy things in a sad world Education for
								All Capturing moments of Happiness Doodle for life Mental Health Nutrition</p>

							<p><b>Note:</b> Every piece of art must have a story/reason/emotion behind it and the artist
								must
								say why he/she chose the topic. Rules and regulations:-</p>

							<p>
								<li> Max 2 members can be in a team during participation. Individual registration is
									to be done by the members.
								<li> The topic will be given on the spot before the
									beginning of the competition.
								<li> The time allotted to each person/team will be 60
									minutes.
								<li> Canvas or Chart papers will have to be arranged by the participant.
								<li> Participants need to have their own materials needed for painting. Any type of
									color is allowed.
								<li> Participants should click the photo of their painting/sketch
									while holding it and send it as entries.
								<li> Participants should draw the art
									themselves.
							</p>

							<p><b> Note:</b> The participant&rsquo;s face, as well as the painting/sketch, should be
								clearly
								visible in the photograph. They can send in multiple photos if required.</p>

							<p><b> #CodeItUp </b></p>

							<p>Are you a fan of technology? Do you enjoy coding and designing your own websites? Are you
								capable of offering a decent answer to a problem? Team Kritarth brings Tech Warz for our
								geeky crowd.Use your technical skills and creativity to provide solutions for the good
								cause beneficial for the people in need.</p>

							<p><b> Theme:</b></p>

							<p><b> 1. Chaitre:</b> Chaitre is a modern, adaptable, and extremely flexible theme for charities,
								donations, and fundraisers.<br>
								Anne Frank's renowned phrase, "No one has ever become poor by giving," has touched the
								hearts of many people. Chaitre is a powerful mood enhancer that energizes the givers'
								lives. Its advantages go well beyond tax breaks and recognition. As a result, research
								shows that people who volunteer for charities feel more fulfilled and happy than those
								who do not. Even though charities have a wide range of purposes, they all have the same
								goal in mind: to promote social welfare for the less fortunate. For these charitable
								groups to spread awareness, they need a good website.<br>
								<b> PROBLEM STATEMENT :</b> <br>
								This theme includes a platform that allows donors to access their dashboard and view
								prior donations as well as payment receipts. Chaitre's specializations include social
								login for donors, Slider Revolution, maintenance mode, and many more.</p>

							<p><b> 2. Lifeline:</b> Lifeline is a perfect platform for charitable organizations and
								non-government organizations. It is very much similar to the Chaitre.<br>
								<b> PROBLEM STATEMENT :</b> <br>
								You'll get access to a fantastic collection of professionally artistically produced
								demos, each with its unique style and a plethora of modification options. The built-in
								Volunteer Management system lets your users enroll on your projects or causes as
								volunteers and allows you to keep track of who they are and what they’ll be volunteering
								with. With Lifeline, receiving donations through credit cards and PayPal is now easier
								than ever before.</p>

							<p><b> 3.UpStream:</b> You need to develop a website for young adults from low-income families that
								helps them learn critical skills and includes college credit and corporate internships.
								So, you have to design a webpage by keeping these points in mind.</p>

							<p><b> 4.Treasure Coast:</b> This animal welfare organisation is a no-kill shelter that accepts
								animals of all ages, health, temperament, and breeds. This theme emphasises on accepting
								animals and caring for them until they are in the best possible health before assisting
								them in finding new homes through adoption.<br>
								This subject is dependent on community participation in more ways than just monetary
								donations. Volunteering, fostering, attending events, purchasing goods, and pet training
								are all easy ways to become involved on the website.</p>

							<p><b> Important:</b><br>
							 <li>	You must create a website to demonstrate your abilities in that field, but the
								fascinating part is that you must also create a website for social purposes. For
								instance, you may need to develop a website that sends out a strong social message from
								the given themes.</li></p>

							<p>The event will consist of three sub-events:</p>

							<p><b> a) Rapid Fire IT Quiz (1 hour)</b><br>
								The teams can discuss among themselves and then raise his/her hand on the meet to answer
								the question first. No discussion is allowed after raising hands.<br>
								2 points for the correct answer and - 1 point for the wrong answer.<br>
								If a team raises their hand before the question is over they will be asked to answer it
								without the question being completed. <br>
								The question has to be answered in 20 seconds.<br>
								If a question is not answered by the first team who raises the hand. The team that
								raised the hand next gets the chance to answer.<br>
								There will be no choices in this round.<br>
								If two teams press the raises his/her hand together there will be a pull of cards to
								decide who gets the chance to answer if. If the first team answers it correctly they get
								a point. If they give a wrong answer they lose 1 point and the next team that raises
								their hand gets to answer.<br>
								There will be a total of 15 questions in this round.<br>
								Each round will be an elimination round.</p>

							<p><b> b) Web page Designing (1.5 Hours) </b></p>

							<p>1. The contest is for those people who will qualify for the first round of tech warz.<br>
								2. It is a team contest with each team having a maximum of five members and a minimum of
								two.<br>
								3. Only one team submission per problem will be allowed as judges will evaluate
								submissions throughout the competition.<br>
								4. Downloaded codes will not be allowed.<br>
								5. In this competition you only have to show the webpage.</p>

							<p><b> c) Coding (2 Hours) </b></p>

							<p>1. The contest is for those people who will qualify for the above two rounds of TECH
								WARZ.<br>
								2. Rules are very much similar to the second-round competition.<br>
								3. But in this round, you have to show your code with proper explanations(with comments
								in your program).<br>
								4. All problems will include some recommended sample data and a proper explanation of
								your code as that will be used during judging.<br>
								5. During the contest, the network must only be used to submit contest problems or
								questions and get responses from the contest officials.</p>
